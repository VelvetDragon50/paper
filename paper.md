# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004)

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental-scale measurements have not been made previously

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.
